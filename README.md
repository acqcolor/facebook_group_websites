# [PublishMyPage](#)

## Goal

Generate public landing pages for FB Group pages.

## What problem are we solving and why?

We devote a lot of time to growing and cultivating our professional and personal Facebook communities, some of us acting as admins to groups with 8,000+ members. However, it is hard to share these accomplishments with people outside of Facebook because of potential lack of access. Not only does it perhaps potential appear less professional to potential hiring managers to include a Facebook link, it is also impossible to view these pages without a Facebook account. We are proud of our communities online and want to be able to share these accomplishments with people outside of Facebook unequivocally.
